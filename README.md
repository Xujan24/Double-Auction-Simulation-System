# Double Auction Simulation System
This is a python implementation for a **double auction simulation system** for single product. It uses `equilibrium match` for
matching two bids. The system outputs all the generated bids, matched bids with clearing price, all unmatched bids and profit
for the auctioneer and each of the traders (buyers and sellers). In addition to that, the program also creates a `.txt` file
including all the outputs.


**Note:**
1. Generated bids format: *(bidid, traderid, tradertype, quantity, bidprice, reservedprice)*
2. Matched and unmatched bid format: *(bidid, traderid, tradertype, quantity, bidprice)*  


Cheers.
